Title: Minimum Operations to Make Array Palindrome
Given an array of positive integers nums, you can perform the following operation any number of times:
Select two adjacent elements and replace them with their sum
The goal is to convert the array into a palindrome using the minimum number of operations possible. A palindrome is an array that reads the same forwards and backwards.
Example 1:
CopyInput: nums = [1, 4, 3, 1]Output: 1Explanation: Perform one operation: combine 4 and 3 to get [1, 7, 1], which is a palindrome.
Example 2:
CopyInput: nums = [1, 2, 3, 4]Output: 3Explanation: - Combine 1 and 2: [3, 3, 4]- Combine 3 and 4: [3, 7]- Combine 3 and 7: [10]The array [10] is a palindrome. 3 operations are needed.
Example 3:
CopyInput: nums = [2, 2, 2]Output: 0Explanation: The array is already a palindrome.
Constraints:
1 ≤ nums.length ≤ 1000
1 ≤ nums[i] ≤ 1000
